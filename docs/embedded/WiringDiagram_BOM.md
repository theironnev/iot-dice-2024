# Bill Of Materials - Embedded Device 

A Bill of Materials (BoM) is a list of all the components, parts, and materials needed to build a particular product or project. It serves as a roadmap for assembling the project by detailing each item required, along with its quantity and specifications.

This BoM enables other developers to easily recreate this project by providing them with a clear list of all the necessary components. This ensures that they have the right materials on hand and understand the exact specifications needed for each part, streamlining the replication process and reducing the likelihood of errors or omissions. Essentially, the BoM acts as a vital reference point for anyone looking to replicate or build upon this project.

### total 
The total of embedded components comes down to 27,756 € 

With pcb manufacturing that is **36,242 €** per device.

Because some of the parts are fragile and i wanted to have a backup for mistakes i ordered every component in triplets so that i can make 3 of the same devices. There are also parts that could not be ordered without a bulk such as the resistors, capacitors and pcb's.

# Wiring Diagram

This is the Wiring diagram of the IoT-device. This diagram shows the wired connection between iC's and electrical components that are needed to replicate this product. This Wiring Diagram is actually a schematic for the pcb design and most of the green wire connections will be placed in the pcb-layout except for the MPU-9250 module sins it is a pre-build pcb module.

In the Wiring diagram modules and components are grouped based on the the functionalities that they are used for in a blue boxes. 
some wiring are not drawn out completely because they are a  part of a net class. Every end-point that you can see with a name is connected with every other end-point with the same name. 
example; 
- beetle_esp IO8 SDA => MPU9250 SDA PIN 24 => MAX17043 SDA PIN 8
- beetle_esp IO9 SCL => MPU9250 SCL PIN 23 => MAX17043 SCL PIN 7

They are all connected for the I2C communication protocol.

All the components have a unique component numbering for when its time to solder them to the pcb. 

example; 
- resistors are labeled from R1 .... R9
- solder jumpers are labeled from JP1 ... JP3

**Note:** This is not actually the Schematic that is used for the PCB. The goal was to use a FlexPCB that is flexible and fits inside a cube. But because this was to expensive an other method is applied by creating Through holes and wiring smaller pcb's together.

The schematic used for this design is down under:

In this design you can see added pins for every module/component that has to sit on a face of the dice.
