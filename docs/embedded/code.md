# Embedded code

This is not a place to put your code, but to describe the code that you have written. You can describe the code in a general way, but also go into detail on specific parts of the code. You can also refer to the code in your repository. So just add a link to the code in your repository

The code for my iot device is made in platform io. 

I decided to go with PlatformIO over Arduino and Espressif for a few key reasons that resonated with my needs and preferences. Firstly, PlatformIO offers a more streamlined and versatile development environment. Unlike Arduino, which can sometimes feel a bit restrictive in terms of supported hardware and libraries, PlatformIO provides compatibility with a wide range of development boards and frameworks, allowing me to work with different microcontrollers beyond just Espressif's offerings.

Moreover, PlatformIO's integrated development environment (IDE) is robust and feature-rich, offering advanced debugging tools, built-in unit testing support, and seamless integration with popular version control systems like Git. This comprehensive toolset not only enhances my productivity but also ensures code reliability and maintainability, which are crucial aspects of any embedded project.

Additionally, PlatformIO's extensive library manager simplifies the process of discovering, installing, and managing libraries, eliminating the hassle of manually handling dependencies—a common pain point when working with Arduino. This streamlined workflow saves me valuable time and effort, allowing me to focus more on actual development rather than administrative tasks.
